Description: The aim of the package 'rcompendium' is to make easier the 
    creation of R package or research compendium (i.e. a predefined 
    files/folders structure) so that users can focus on the code/analysis
    instead of wasting time organizing files. A full ready-to-work structure 
    is set up with some additional features: version control, remote repository
    creation, CI/CD configuration (check package integrity under several OS, 
    test code with 'testthat', and build and deploy website using 'pkgdown'). 
    This package heavily relies on the R packages 'devtools' and 'usethis'.
