The goal of `rcompendium` is to create a research compendium, i.e. a predefined
folder structure.



## Mea culpa

...



## Structure of the compendium

Here is the structure of the research compendium created by `rcompendium`:

```
compendium           # Project Root
│
├── .git             # Automatically created (or not)
├── .Rbuildignore    # Contains make.R and analysis/
├── .gitignore       # Specific to R projects
├── compendium.Rproj # Created by user (optional)
│
├── R/               # Contains R functions
├── man/             # Contains R functions helps (automatically updated)
├── DESCRIPTION      # Project metadata (author, date, dependencies, etc.)
├── NAMESPACE
├── LICENSE.md       # Content of the chosen license
|
├── analysis/
│   ├── data/        # Contains user raw data (.csv, .xlsx, .shp, etc.)
│   ├── rscripts/    # Contains R scripts to run analyses
│   ├── outputs/     # Contains outputs created by user
│   └── figures/     # Contains figures created by user
├── make.R           # Master R scripts to run all analyses
│
├── README.md        # GitHub README (automatically updated)
└── README.Rmd       # GitHub README (to rmarkdown::render)
```



The package `rcompendium` can also be used to create an R package with the 
following content:


```
package              # Package Root
│
├── .git/            # Automatically created (or not)
├── .github/         # GitHub Actions settings (check and deploy)
├── .Rbuildignore
├── .gitignore       # Specific to R projects
├── compendium.Rproj # Created by user (optional)
├── _pkgdown.yml     # Website settings
│
├── R/               # Contains R functions
├── man/             # Contains R functions helps (automatically updated)
├── inst/            # (optional)
├── tests/           # (optional)
├── vignettes/       # (optional)
├── DESCRIPTION      # Project metadata (author, dependencies, etc.)
├── NAMESPACE
├── LICENSE.md       # Content of the chosen license
│
├── README.md        # GitHub README (automatically updated)
└── README.Rmd       # GitHub README (to rmarkdown::render)
```




**N.B. 1.** the research compendium can be built as an R package with 
`devtools::install()` but only R functions stored in the **R/** folder will
be available (do not forget to edit R functions documentation and to run
`devtools::document()`). 
The content of the **analysis/** folder must be run by sourcing the `make.R` 
file. All files created by user must be saved in the subfolders of **analysis/**.


**N.B. 2.** the files `DESCRIPTION` and `make.R` are written from templates and
are specific to myself.



## Installation



You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("FRBCesab/rcompendium")
```



## Usage

Under RStudio, you first need to create a **New project** (with or without
initializing git versioning). If you do not use RStudio IDE, you need to create
a **New folder** and to open R in this directory (by using `setwd()`).

**N.B.** the name of the compendium will be the same as the current directory.
Don't worry you will be asked before any file is created.

Then you can create the compendium:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rcompendium::new_compendium()
```

You can now start working!
