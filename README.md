In the area of open science, making reproducible analyses is a strong
prerequisite. But sometimes it is difficult 1) to find the good
structure to organize files and 2) to set up the whole project. The aim
of the package `rcompendium` is to make easier the creation of R
package/research compendium (i.e.Â a predefined files/folders structure)
so that users can focus on the code/analysis instead of wasting time
organizing files.

A full ready-to-work structure will be set up with the following
features:

-   Initialization of the [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) version control.
-   Creation of a minimal R package structure (`DESCRIPTION` and
    `NAMESPACE` files, and `R/` and `man/` folders).
-   Creation of additional files (`LICENSE.md`, `inst/CITATION`, etc.).
-   Creation of a *Get started* vignette in `vignettes/`.
-   Setting the units tests process in `tests/`.
-   Creation of a `README.Rmd` with HexSticker (template) and badges.
-   Autocompletion of maintainer information.
-   Creation of a GitHub repository.
-   Configuration of GitHub Actions to automatically:
    -   check and test package (`R CMD Check`);
    -   report the code coverage (`covr`);
    -   build and deploy website (`pkgdown`);
    -   render `README.md`.

This package heavily relies on the R packages
[`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org) and
[`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org) and follows recommendations made
by [Hadley Wickham & Jenny Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org) and [Ben
Marwick](https://peerj.com/preprints/3192/).

## Colophon

This package is the result of intense discussions and feedback from the
training course [Data Toolbox for Reproducible Research in Computational
Ecology](https://github.com/FRBCesab/datatoolbox) (in French).

`rcompendium` is largely inspired by the package
[`rrtools`](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) developed by [Ben
Marwick *et al.*](https://github.com/benmarwick) and tries to respect
the standard defined by the community. **Special thanks to these
developers!**
