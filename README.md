In the area of open science, making reproducible analyses is a strong
prerequisite. But sometimes it is difficult 1) to find the good
structure to organize files and 2) to set up the whole project. The aim
of the package `rcompendium` is to make easier the creation of R
package/research compendium (i.e.Â a predefined files/folders structure)
so that users can focus on the code/analysis instead of wasting time
organizing files.

A full ready-to-work structure will be set up with the following
features:

- Initialization of version control with [git](https://git-scm.com/).
- Creation of a minimal R package structure (`DESCRIPTION` and
  `NAMESPACE` files, and `R/` and `man/` folders).
- Creation of additional files (`LICENSE.md`, `inst/CITATION`, etc.).
- Creation of a *Get started* vignette in `vignettes/` (package only).
- Setting the units tests process in `tests/`.
- Creation of a `README.Rmd` with HexSticker (template) and badges.
- Autocompletion of maintainer information.
- Initialization of the `renv` system (if required).
- Creation of a Dockerfile (if required).
- Creation of a GitHub repository.
- Configuration of GitHub Actions to automatically:
  - check and test package (`R CMD Check`);
  - report the code coverage (`covr`);
  - build and deploy website (`pkgdown`);
  - render `README.md`.

This package heavily relies on the R packages
[`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org) and
[`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org) and follows recommendations made
by [Hadley Wickham & Jenny Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org) and [Ben
Marwick](https://peerj.com/preprints/3192/).

## Colophon

This package is the result of intense discussions and feedback from the
training course [Reproducible Research in Computational
Ecology](https://rdatatoolbox.github.io/).

`rcompendium` is largely inspired by the package
[`rrtools`](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) developed by [Ben
Marwick *et al.*](https://github.com/benmarwick) and tries to respect
the standard defined by the community.
